# Deployment Diagram Guidelines

## Basic Principles
- Use deployment diagrams to show physical system architecture
- Show hardware nodes, software components, and their relationships
- Illustrate how software artifacts are deployed to hardware
- Focus on runtime environment and infrastructure

## Best Practices
- Clearly distinguish between nodes (hardware/environments) and artifacts (software)
- Show communication paths between nodes
- Include relevant deployment specifications and constraints
- Use consistent naming for environments (dev, staging, prod)
- Show dependencies and connections clearly

## Styling Recommendations
- Use 3D boxes or nodes for hardware/execution environments
- Use rectangles for software components/artifacts
- Use lines with labels for communication protocols
- Group related components in the same deployment environment
- Use colors to distinguish different types of nodes or environments

## Common Elements
- **Nodes**: Physical or virtual hardware (Server, Database, Load Balancer)
- **Artifacts**: Deployable software units (WAR files, executables, containers)
- **Communication**: Network connections and protocols (HTTP, TCP, etc.)
- **Stereotypes**: Component types (<<web server>>, <<database>>, <<application>>)
- **Dependencies**: Required connections between deployed components
- **Specifications**: Hardware specs, software versions, configurations
