# Sequence Diagram Guidelines

## Theme 
Always use theme :sunlust

## Basic Principles
- Use sequence diagrams to show interactions between objects over time
- Time flows from top to bottom
- Participants should be arranged left to right in order of first interaction
- Keep diagrams focused on a single scenario or use case

## Best Practices
- Limit diagram to 5-7 participants for readability
- Use activation bars to clearly show when participants are active
- Include return messages for clarity
- Use notes to explain complex logic or conditions
- Group related messages with boxes or alt/opt fragments

## Styling Recommendations
- Use colors consistently (actors one color, systems another)
- Add titles to clearly identify the scenario
- Consider using skinparam to customize appearance
- Use numbered messages for complex diagrams
