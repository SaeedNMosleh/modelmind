# Class Diagram Guidelines

## Basic Principles
- Use class diagrams to show the structure of a system
- Classes should represent distinct concepts or entities
- Relationships show how classes interact or relate
- Attributes and methods should be relevant to the domain

## Best Practices
- Keep class names singular and nouns (e.g., "Customer" not "Customers")
- Use proper visibility markers (+, -, #, ~)
- Organize classes in logical groups
- Avoid deep inheritance hierarchies (prefer composition)
- Include only essential attributes and methods

## Styling Recommendations
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Group related classes with packages
- Use colors to distinguish different types of classes
- Position associated classes near each other
